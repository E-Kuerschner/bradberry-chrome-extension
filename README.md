## Why
Bradberry your friends by installing this chrome extension on their computer while they are not in the room.
Plays an annoying sound clip every time the user clicks anywhere on any page.

## Installation & Setup
1. Download zip folder to the computer and extract the bradberry-chrome-extension-master folder.
2. Open a new tab in Google Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions
3. Enable 'Developer Mode' in the top right corner.
4. Click 'Load unpacked extension...'
5. Select the folder you just extracted and you should be good to go.
6. All tabs will need to be refreshed in order for the new extension to take effect.

Hint: You may want to hide the extension's button in chrome's extension menu (top right of the window) if you think the unfortunate friend you are pranking will notice. You can do this by clicking the rectangular icon and selecting 'Hide in Chrome Menu'.

To Remove: Return to chrome://extensions and disable the Bradberry Click extension or remove it from Chrome completely by clicking the trash bin icon.
